Here's how you can format your patch notes using Discord markdown, each change as a bullet point with the type of change bolded:\n\n```\n**Balance(elysiera):**\n- Changed some boss categories.\n\n**Fix:**\n- Addressed an issue where Tereban was not giving the old cape.\n- Fixed a problem with the map of Drefia.\n- Corrected an issue preventing spellbook identification in Elysiera.\n- Resolved Tereban's dialogue issue.\n- Fixed the cooldown bonuses for Wheel of Destiny.\n- Addressed a bug affecting the basic avatar stage from transcendence.\n\n**Feat:**\n- Introduced the Sam's Backpack Raid.\n\n**Map(elysiera):**\n- Performed adjustments to the Drefia map layout.\n```\n\nNote: Given that some of the fixes and adjustments were mentioned more than once (e.g., \"fix drefia\"), I've consolidated them to avoid redundancy in your patch notes. Ensure to provide additional specifics in your actual notes if the repeated commits addressed different issues within the same category.\ngroup map into fixes and you don't need the (elysiera), also the type should be in each bullet point, so the whole thing is a flat list\nCertainly, here is a revised version with `map` changes grouped under `Fix` and the removal of `(elysiera)` for clarity, keeping the format flat and including the change type in each bullet:\n\n```\n- **Balance:** Changed some boss categories.\n- **Fix:** Addressed an issue where Tereban was not giving the old cape.\n- **Fix:** Fixed a problem with the map of Drefia.\n- **Feat:** Introduced the Sam's Backpack Raid.\n- **Fix:** Corrected an issue preventing spellbook identification.\n- **Fix:** Resolved Tereban's dialogue issue.\n- **Fix:** Fixed the cooldown bonuses for Wheel of Destiny.\n- **Fix:** Addressed a bug affecting the basic avatar stage from transcendence.\n- **Fix:** Performed adjustments to the Drefia map layout.\n```\n\nThis format presents all changes as a flat list, with the type of change bolded for each bullet point.\ninstead of Fix: use the style Fixed ... where we form a sentence with the change\nAbsolutely, below is the revised format with each change forming a complete sentence under a uniform list:\n\n```\nHH\n```\n\nThis format aims to keep the text cohesive and easy to understand, with each bullet point describing the change in a clear, actionable sentence.\n\nin rust, how can i round an f32 to the nearest 0.05?\nTo round an `f32` to the nearest `0.05` in Rust, you can multiply the number by `20` (since `1 / 0.05 = 20`), round it to the nearest whole number, and then divide it back by `20`. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```rust\nfn round_to_nearest_0_05(value: f32) -> f32 {\n    (value * 20.0).round() / 20.0\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let value = 0.123;\n    let rounded_value = round_to_nearest_0_05(value);\n    println!(\"Original value: {}\", value);\n    println!(\"Rounded value: {}\", rounded_value);\n}\n```\n\nThis function works by scaling the original `f32` value so that `0.05` becomes `1.0`, rounding to the nearest whole number (which now corresponds to rounding to the nearest `0.05` in the original scale), and then scaling back to the original range.\nhow about neared 0.25\n\nTo round an `f32` to the nearest `0.25`, you would follow a similar approach to rounding to the nearest `0.05`, but you would use `4` instead of `20` because `1 / 0.25 = 4`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```rust\nfn round_to_nearest_0_25(value: f32) -> f32 {\n    (value * 4.0).round() / 4.0\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let value = 0.33;\n    let rounded_value = round_to_nearest_0_25(value);\n    println!(\"Original value: {}\", value);\n    println!(\"Rounded value: {}\", rounded_value);\n}\n```\n\nThis code snippet works by adjusting the scale so that `0.25` becomes `1.0` (multiplying the value by `4`), rounding it to the nearest whole number, and then scaling it back to the original range by dividing by `4`. This effectively rounds the input value to the nearest `0.25`.\n","messages":[{"id":0,"start":0},{"id":1,"start":892},{"id":2,"start":1865},{"id":3,"start":2001},{"id":4,"start":2834},{"id":5,"start":2915},{"id":6,"start":3180},{"id":7,"start":3234},{"id":8,"start":3972},{"id":9,"start":3995},{"id":10,"start":4752}],"message_metadata":{"9":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-03-30T22:05:23.284715-07:00","status":"Done"},"10":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-03-30T22:05:23.284904-07:00","status":"Done"},"6":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-03-30T21:48:30.451755-07:00","status":"Done"},"8":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-03-30T22:03:52.010914-07:00","status":"Done"},"0":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-03-30T21:46:38.113656-07:00","status":"Done"},"1":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-03-30T21:47:11.877326-07:00","status":"Done"},"2":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-03-30T21:47:11.878681-07:00","status":"Done"},"3":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-03-30T21:47:54.445121-07:00","status":"Done"},"4":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-03-30T21:47:54.446077-07:00","status":"Done"},"5":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-03-30T21:48:30.450412-07:00","status":"Done"},"7":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-03-30T22:03:52.009732-07:00","status":"Done"}},"summary":"Writing Discord Patch Notes for a Commit History"}
