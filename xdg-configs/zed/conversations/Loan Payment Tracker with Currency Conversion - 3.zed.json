Each step should describe a high-level change, which can consist of multiple edits to distinct locations in the codebase.\n\n## Output Example\n\nProvide output as XML, with the following format:\n\n<step>\nUpdate the Person struct to store an age\n\n```rust\nstruct Person {\n    // existing fields...\n    age: u8,\n    height: f32,\n    // existing fields...\n}\n\nimpl Person {\n    fn age(&self) -> u8 {\n        self.age\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/person.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_before</operation>\n<search>height: f32,</search>\n<description>Add the age field</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/person.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_after</operation>\n<search>impl Person {</search>\n<description>Add the age getter</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n## Output Format\n\nFirst, each `<step>` must contain a written description of the change that should be made. The description should begin with a high-level overview, and can contain markdown code blocks as well. The description should be self-contained and actionable.\n\nAfter the description, each `<step>` must contain one or more `<edit>` tags, each of which refer to a specific range in a source file. Each `<edit>` tag must contain the following child tags:\n\n### `<path>` (required)\n\nThis tag contains the path to the file that will be changed. It can be an existing path, or a path that should be created.\n\n### `<search>` (optional)\n\nThis tag contains a search string to locate in the source file, e.g. `pub fn baz() {`. If not provided, the new content will be inserted at the top of the file. Make sure to produce a string that exists in the source file and that isn't ambiguous. When there's ambiguity, add more lines to the search to eliminate it.\n\n### `<description>` (required)\n\nThis tag contains a single-line description of the edit that should be made at the given location.\n\n### `<operation>` (required)\n\nThis tag indicates what type of change should be made, relative to the given location. It can be one of the following:\n- `update`: Rewrites the specified string entirely based on the given description.\n- `create`: Creates a new file with the given path based on the provided description.\n- `insert_before`: Inserts new text based on the given description before the specified search string.\n- `insert_after`: Inserts new text based on the given description after the specified search string.\n- `delete`: Deletes the specified string from the containing file.\n\n<guidelines>\n- There's no need to describe *what* to do, just *where* to do it.\n- Only reference locations that actually exist (unless you're creating a file).\n- If creating a file, assume any subsequent updates are included at the time of creation.\n- Don't create and then update a file. Always create new files in one hot.\n- Prefer multiple edits to smaller regions, as opposed to one big edit to a larger region.\n- Don't produce edits that intersect each other. In that case, merge them into a bigger edit.\n- Never nest an edit with another edit. Never include CDATA. All edits are leaf nodes.\n- Descriptions are required for all edits except delete.\n- When generating multiple edits, ensure the descriptions are specific to each individual operation.\n- Avoid referring to the search string in the description. Focus on the change to be made, not the location where it's made. That's implicit with the `search` string you provide.\n- Don't generate multiple edits at the same location. Instead, combine them together in a single edit with a succinct combined description.\n- Always ensure imports are added if you're referencing symbols that are not in scope.\n</guidelines>\n\nHere are some concrete examples.\n\n<example>\n<message role=\"user\">\n\n```rs src/shapes.rs\npub mod rectangle;\npub mod circle;\n```\n\n```rs src/shapes/rectangle.rs\npub struct Rectangle {\n    width: f64,\n    height: f64,\n}\n\nimpl Rectangle {\n    pub fn new(width: f64, height: f64) -> Self {\n        Rectangle { width, height }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```rs src/shapes/circle.rs\npub struct Circle {\n    radius: f64,\n}\n\nimpl Circle {\n    pub fn new(radius: f64) -> Self {\n        Circle { radius }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nUpdate all shapes to store their origin as an (x, y) tuple and implement Display.\n</message>\n\n<message role=\"assistant\">\nWe'll need to update both the rectangle and circle modules.\n\n<step>\nAdd origin fields to both shape types.\n\n```rust\nstruct Rectangle {\n    // existing fields ...\n    origin: (f64, f64),\n}\n```\n\n```rust\nstruct Circle {\n    // existing fields ...\n    origin: (f64, f64),\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/rectangle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_before</operation>\n<search>\n    width: f64,\n    height: f64,\n</search>\n<description>Add the origin field to Rectangle</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/circle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_before</operation>\n<search>\n    radius: f64,\n</search>\n<description>Add the origin field to Circle</description>\n</edit>\n\n<step>\nUpdate both shape's constructors to take an origin.\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/rectangle.rs</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<search>\n    fn new(width: f64, height: f64) -> Self {\n        Rectangle { width, height }\n    }\n</search>\n<description>Update the Rectangle new function to take an origin</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/circle.rs</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<search>\n    fn new(radius: f64) -> Self {\n        Circle { radius }\n    }\n</search>\n<description>Update the Circle new function to take an origin</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nImplement Display for both shapes\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/rectangle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_before</operation>\n<search>\nstruct Rectangle {\n</search>\n<description>Add an import for the `std::fmt` module</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/rectangle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_after</operation>\n<search>\n        Rectangle { width, height }\n    }\n}\n</search>\n<description>Add a Display implementation for Rectangle</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/circle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_before</operation>\n<search>\nstruct Circle {\n</search>\n<description>Add an import for the `std::fmt` module</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/circle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_after</operation>\n<search>\n        Circle { radius }\n    }\n}\n</search>\n<description>Add a Display implementation for Circle</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n</message>\n</example>\n\n<example number=2>\n<message role=\"user\">\n\n```rs src/user.rs\nstruct User {\n    pub name: String,\n    age: u32,\n    email: String,\n}\n\nimpl User {\n    fn new(name: String, age: u32, email: String) -> Self {\n        User { name, age, email }\n    }\n\n    pub fn print_info(&self) {\n        todo!()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nLet's print all the user information and delete the email field.\n</message>\n\n<message role=\"assistant\">\n<step>\nUpdate the 'print_info' method to print user information\n\n```rust\nimpl User {\n    // ... other methods ...\n\n    pub fn print_info(&self) {\n        println!(\"Name: {name}, Age: {age}\", name = self.name, age = self.age);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/user.rs</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<search>\n    pub fn print_info(&self) {\n        todo!()\n    }\n</search>\n<description>Print all the user information</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nRemove the 'email' field from the User struct\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/user.rs</path>\n<operation>delete</operation>\n<search>\nemail: String,\n</search>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/user.rs</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<symbol>\nfn new(name: String, age: u32, email: String) -> Self {\n    User { name, age, email }\n}\n</symbol>\n<description>Remove email parameter from new method</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n</message>\n</example>\n\nYou should think step by step.

Everything should default to USD, but the user should be able to pick a potentially different currency for the lender and borrower, if the currencies differ, the app should automatically translate into the appropriate currency using a publicly available exchange rate api.\n\nIf the monthly payment amount exceeds a pre-configured value, it should turn red, letting the user know they have some catching up to do.\n\nÂ \nCertainly! I'll guide you through the process of transforming this Mac app into a loan tracking application with the features you've described. We'll break this down into several steps.\n\n<step>\nFirst, let's create a Loan model to represent the loan details.\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nstruct Loan: Codable {\n    var amount: Double\n    var startDate: Date\n    var endDate: Date\n    var lenderCurrency: String\n    var borrowerCurrency: String\n    var payments: [Payment]\n}\n\nstruct Payment: Codable, Identifiable {\n    let id: UUID\n    var amount: Double\n    var date: Date\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>loantracker/Sources/LoanTracker/Models/Loan.swift</path>\n<operation>create</operation>\n<description>Create a new file for the Loan and Payment models</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nNow, let's update the AppViewModel to manage the loan data and calculations.\n\n```swift\nimport SwiftUI\nimport Combine\n\nclass AppViewModel: ObservableObject {\n    @Published var loan: Loan\n    @Published var monthlyPayment: Double = 0\n    @Published var remainingBalance: Double = 0\n    @Published var warningThreshold: Double = 1000 // Default warning threshold\n    \n    private var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()\n    \n    init() {\n        self.loan = Loan(amount: 10000, startDate: Date(), endDate: Date().addingTimeInterval(365*24*60*60), lenderCurrency: \"USD\", borrowerCurrency: \"USD\", payments: [])\n        calculateMonthlyPayment()\n        setupBindings()\n    }\n    \n    private func setupBindings() {\n        $loan\n            .sink { [weak self] _ in\n                self?.calculateMonthlyPayment()\n            }\n            .store(in: &cancellables)\n    }\n    \n    func calculateMonthlyPayment() {\n        let totalMonths = Calendar.current.dateComponents([.month], from: loan.startDate, to: loan.endDate).month ?? 1\n        let totalPaid = loan.payments.reduce(0) { $0 + $1.amount }\n        remainingBalance = loan.amount - totalPaid\n        monthlyPayment = remainingBalance / Double(totalMonths)\n    }\n    \n    func addPayment(_ amount: Double) {\n        loan.payments.append(Payment(id: UUID(), amount: amount, date: Date()))\n        calculateMonthlyPayment()\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>loantracker/Sources/LoanTracker/AppViewModel.swift</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<search>class AppViewModel: ObservableObject {\n}</search>\n<description>Update AppViewModel with loan management logic</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nNext, let's create a CurrencyConverter service to handle currency conversion.\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nclass CurrencyConverter {\n    static let shared = CurrencyConverter()\n    \n    func convertCurrency(amount: Double, from: String, to: String) async throws -> Double {\n        // TODO: Implement actual API call to a currency conversion service\n        // For now, we'll just return the same amount\n        return amount\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>loantracker/Sources/LoanTracker/Services/CurrencyConverter.swift</path>\n<operation>create</operation>\n<description>Create a new file for the CurrencyConverter service</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nNow, let's update the ContentView to display the loan information and allow for adding payments.\n\n```swift\nimport SwiftUI\n\nstruct ContentView: View {\n    @StateObject private var viewModel = AppViewModel()\n    @State private var newPaymentAmount: String = \"\"\n    \n    var body: some View {\n        VStack(spacing: 20) {\n            Text(\"Loan Tracker\").font(.largeTitle)\n            \n            HStack {\n                VStack(alignment: .leading) {\n                    Text(\"Loan Amount: $\\(viewModel.loan.amount, specifier: \"%.2f\")\")\n                    Text(\"Start Date: \\(viewModel.loan.startDate, style: .date)\")\n                    Text(\"End Date: \\(viewModel.loan.endDate, style: .date)\")\n                }\n                Spacer()\n                VStack(alignment: .trailing) {\n                    Text(\"Lender Currency: \\(viewModel.loan.lenderCurrency)\")\n                    Text(\"Borrower Currency: \\(viewModel.loan.borrowerCurrency)\")\n                }\n            }\n            \n            Text(\"Remaining Balance: $\\(viewModel.remainingBalance, specifier: \"%.2f\")\")\n                .font(.headline)\n            \n            Text(\"Monthly Payment: $\\(viewModel.monthlyPayment, specifier: \"%.2f\")\")\n                .font(.headline)\n                .foregroundColor(viewModel.monthlyPayment > viewModel.warningThreshold ?

Display loan details including amount, start date, end date, and currencies.\n2. Show the remaining balance and calculated monthly payment.\n3. Allow adding new payments.\n4. Display a list of all payments made.\n5. Turn the monthly payment text red if it exceeds the warning threshold.\n\nNote that the currency conversion is not fully implemented yet. To complete this feature, you would need to:\n1. Implement the CurrencyConverter service to use a real currency exchange API.\n2. Update the AppViewModel to use the CurrencyConverter when calculating balances and payments in different currencies.\n\nAlso, you might want to add more features like editing loan details, removing payments, and persisting data between app launches. These could be added in future iterations of the app.\nLet's persist the data somewhere. Let's use some strong encryption and a local file. The user should be able to chose a location for the file, and the app should be able to read and write to that location.\nCertainly! We'll implement data persistence using local file storage with encryption. We'll use Apple's CryptoKit for encryption and FileManager for file operations. We'll also add functionality for the user to choose the file location.\n\nLet's break this down into steps:\n\n<step>\nFirst, let's create a FileManager extension to handle file operations and encryption.\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\nimport CryptoKit\n\nextension FileManager {\n    static func getDocumentsDirectory() -> URL {\n        let paths = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)\n        return paths[0]\n    }\n}\n\nclass SecureStorage {\n    static let shared = SecureStorage()\n    \n    private let key: SymmetricKey\n    \n    private init() {\n        // In a real app, you'd want to securely store and retrieve this key\n        // For this example, we're using a hardcoded key\n        self.key = SymmetricKey(data: Data(repeating: 0, count: 32))\n    }\n    \n    func encrypt(_ data: Data) throws -> Data {\n        let sealedBox = try AES.GCM.seal(data, using: key)\n        return sealedBox.combined!\n    }\n    \n    func decrypt(_ data: Data) throws -> Data {\n        let sealedBox = try AES.GCM.SealedBox(combined: data)\n        return try AES.GCM.open(sealedBox, using: key)\n    }\n    \n    func save<T: Encodable>(_ object: T, to url: URL) throws {\n        let data = try JSONEncoder().encode(object)\n        let encryptedData = try encrypt(data)\n        try encryptedData.write(to: url)\n    }\n    \n    func load<T: Decodable>(from url: URL) throws -> T {\n        let encryptedData = try Data(contentsOf: url)\n        let decryptedData = try decrypt(encryptedData)\n        return try JSONDecoder().decode(T.self, from: decryptedData)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>loantracker/Sources/LoanTracker/Utilities/SecureStorage.swift</path>\n<operation>create</operation>\n<description>Create a new file for secure storage utilities</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nNow, let's update the AppViewModel to use the SecureStorage for data persistence.\n\n```swift\nimport SwiftUI\nimport Combine\nimport UniformTypeIdentifiers\n\nclass AppViewModel: ObservableObject {\n    @Published var loan: Loan\n    @Published var monthlyPayment: Double = 0\n    @Published var remainingBalance: Double = 0\n    @Published var warningThreshold: Double = 1000 // Default warning threshold\n    @Published var fileURL: URL?\n    \n    private var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()\n    \n    init() {\n        self.loan = Loan(amount: 10000, startDate: Date(), endDate: Date().addingTimeInterval(365*24*60*60), lenderCurrency: \"USD\", borrowerCurrency: \"USD\", payments: [])\n        calculateMonthlyPayment()\n        setupBindings()\n    }\n    \n    private func setupBindings() {\n        $loan\n            .sink { [weak self] _ in\n                self?.calculateMonthlyPayment()\n                self?.saveLoan()\n            }\n            .store(in: &cancellables)\n    }\n    \n    func calculateMonthlyPayment() {\n        let totalMonths = Calendar.current.dateComponents([.month], from: loan.startDate, to: loan.endDate).month ??

Secure storage of loan data using AES encryption.\n2. Ability to save loan data to a user-specified file location.\n3. Ability to load loan data from a user-specified file.\n4. Automatic saving of loan data whenever changes are made.\n\nA few important notes:\n\n1. The encryption key is hardcoded in this example. In a real application, you would want to securely store and retrieve this key, possibly using the Keychain.\n\n2. Error handling is minimal in this example. In a production app, you'd want to add more robust error handling and user feedback.\n\n3. The file operations are performed on the main thread for simplicity. In a real app, you might want to move these to background threads to avoid blocking the UI.\n\n4. The app doesn't currently handle the case where the user tries to load an invalid or corrupted file. You might want to add additional error checking and recovery mechanisms.\n\n5. The current implementation overwrites the entire file each time a change is made. For larger datasets or more frequent changes, you might want to implement a more efficient update mechanism.\n\nThese additions provide a basic implementation of secure, local file storage for the loan tracking app. Users can now choose where to save their loan data and load it again later, with the data being encrypted for security.\n\n\nloantracker/Sources/LoanTracker\n```swift loantracker/Sources/LoanTracker/AppViewModel.swift\nimport Combine\nimport SwiftUI\nimport UniformTypeIdentifiers\n\nclass AppViewModel: ObservableObject {\n    @Published var loan: Loan\n    @Published var monthlyPayment: Double = 0\n    @Published var remainingBalance: Double = 0\n    @Published var warningThreshold: Double = 1000  // Default warning threshold\n    @Published var fileURL: URL?\n\n    private var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()\n\n    init() {\n        self.loan = Loan(\n            amount: 10000, startDate: Date(),\n            endDate: Date().addingTimeInterval(365 * 24 * 60 * 60), lenderCurrency: \"USD\",\n            borrowerCurrency: \"USD\", payments: [])\n        calculateMonthlyPayment()\n        setupBindings()\n    }\n\n    private func setupBindings() {\n        $loan\n            .sink { [weak self] _ in\n                self?.calculateMonthlyPayment()\n                Task { @MainActor in\n                    await self?.saveLoan()\n                }\n            }\n            .store(in: &cancellables)\n    }\n\n    func calculateMonthlyPayment() {\n        let totalMonths =\n            Calendar.current.dateComponents([.month], from: loan.startDate, to: loan.endDate).month\n            ??

Here's a summary of what we did:\n\n1. We made AppViewModel a @MainActor class, which ensures all its methods run on the main thread.\n2. We removed the async/await from the AppViewModel methods since they're now all running on the main actor.\n3. In ContentView, we wrapped the calls to chooseFile() and saveAs() in Task blocks to handle the asynchronous nature of these operations.\n4. We changed SecureStorage from a class to an actor, which provides built-in synchronization for its methods.\n\nThese changes should resolve the compile-time errors and provide a more robust concurrency model for our app. The app should now compile and run without issues related to concurrency.\n\nloantracker/Sources/LoanTracker\n```swift loantracker/Sources/LoanTracker/AppViewModel.swift\nimport Combine\nimport SwiftUI\nimport UniformTypeIdentifiers\n\n@MainActor\nclass AppViewModel: ObservableObject {\n    @Published var loan: Loan\n    @Published var monthlyPayment: Double = 0\n    @Published var remainingBalance: Double = 0\n    @Published var warningThreshold: Double = 1000  // Default warning threshold\n    @Published var fileURL: URL?\n\n    private var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()\n\n    init() {\n        self.loan = Loan(\n            amount: 10000, startDate: Date(),\n            endDate: Date().addingTimeInterval(365 * 24 * 60 * 60), lenderCurrency: \"USD\",\n            borrowerCurrency: \"USD\", payments: [])\n        calculateMonthlyPayment()\n        setupBindings()\n    }\n\n    private func setupBindings() {\n        $loan\n            .sink { [weak self] _ in\n                self?.calculateMonthlyPayment()\n                Task { @MainActor in\n                    await self?.saveLoan()\n                }\n            }\n            .store(in: &cancellables)\n    }\n\n    func calculateMonthlyPayment() {\n        let totalMonths =\n            Calendar.current.dateComponents([.month], from: loan.startDate, to: loan.endDate).month\n            ??

The issue is likely caused by blocking the main thread when showing the file picker. Let's modify the `AppViewModel` to use a separate thread for file operations while keeping the UI responsive. Here's how we can fix this:\n\n<step>\nUpdate the AppViewModel to use a separate dispatch queue for file operations:\n\n```swift\nimport Combine\nimport SwiftUI\nimport UniformTypeIdentifiers\n\n@MainActor\nclass AppViewModel: ObservableObject {\n    @Published var loan: Loan\n    @Published var monthlyPayment: Double = 0\n    @Published var remainingBalance: Double = 0\n    @Published var warningThreshold: Double = 1000  // Default warning threshold\n    @Published var fileURL: URL?\n\n    private var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()\n    private let fileQueue = DispatchQueue(label: \"com.loantracker.fileoperations\", qos: .userInitiated)\n\n    init() {\n        self.loan = Loan(\n            amount: 10000, startDate: Date(),\n            endDate: Date().addingTimeInterval(365 * 24 * 60 * 60), lenderCurrency: \"USD\",\n            borrowerCurrency: \"USD\", payments: [])\n        calculateMonthlyPayment()\n        setupBindings()\n    }\n\n    private func setupBindings() {\n        $loan\n            .sink { [weak self] _ in\n                self?.calculateMonthlyPayment()\n                Task { @MainActor in\n                    await self?.saveLoan()\n                }\n            }\n            .store(in: &cancellables)\n    }\n\n    func calculateMonthlyPayment() {\n        let totalMonths =\n            Calendar.current.dateComponents([.month], from: loan.startDate, to: loan.endDate).month\n            ?? 1\n        let totalPaid = loan.payments.reduce(0) { $0 + $1.amount }\n        remainingBalance = loan.amount - totalPaid\n        monthlyPayment = remainingBalance / Double(totalMonths)\n    }\n\n    func addPayment(_ amount: Double) {\n        loan.payments.append(Payment(id: UUID(), amount: amount, date: Date()))\n        calculateMonthlyPayment()\n    }\n\n    func saveLoan() async {\n        guard let url = fileURL else { return }\n        do {\n            try await SecureStorage.shared.save(loan, to: url)\n        } catch {\n            print(\"Failed to save loan: \\(error)\")\n        }\n    }\n\n    func loadLoan(from url: URL) async {\n        do {\n            loan = try await SecureStorage.shared.load(from: url)\n            fileURL = url\n            calculateMonthlyPayment()\n        } catch {\n            print(\"Failed to load loan: \\(error)\")\n        }\n    }\n\n    func chooseFile() {\n        fileQueue.async {\n            let panel = NSOpenPanel()\n            panel.allowsMultipleSelection = false\n            panel.canChooseDirectories = false\n            panel.allowedContentTypes = [UTType.data]\n\n            if panel.runModal() == .OK {\n                if let url = panel.url {\n                    Task { @MainActor in\n                        await self.loadLoan(from: url)\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    func saveAs() {\n        fileQueue.async {\n            let panel = NSSavePanel()\n            panel.allowedContentTypes = [UTType.data]\n            panel.canCreateDirectories = true\n            panel.isExtensionHidden = false\n            panel.allowsOtherFileTypes = false\n            panel.title = \"Save Loan Data\"\n            panel.message = \"Choose a location to save your loan data\"\n            panel.nameFieldLabel = \"File name:\"\n\n            if panel.runModal() == .OK {\n                if let url = panel.url {\n                    Task { @MainActor in\n                        self.fileURL = url\n                        await self.saveLoan()\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>loantracker/Sources/LoanTracker/AppViewModel.swift</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<search>@MainActor\nclass AppViewModel: ObservableObject {</search>\n<description>Update AppViewModel to use a separate dispatch queue for file operations</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\nThis change introduces a new `fileQueue` for handling file operations. The `chooseFile()` and `saveAs()` methods now run on this queue, which prevents them from blocking the main thread. After a file is selected, we use a `Task` to switch back to the main actor for updating the UI and performing the actual load/save operations.\n\n<step>\nUpdate the ContentView to remove the Task wrappers, as they're no longer needed:\n\n```swift\nimport SwiftUI\n\nstruct ContentView: View {\n    @StateObject private var viewModel = AppViewModel()\n    @State private var newPaymentAmount: String = \"\"\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack(spacing: 20) {\n            Text(\"Loan Tracker\").font(.largeTitle)\n\n            HStack {\n                Button(\"Load File\") {\n                    viewModel.chooseFile()\n                }\n                Button(\"Save As\") {\n                    viewModel.saveAs()\n                }\n            }\n\n            // ... rest of the view remains the same\n        }\n        .padding()\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>loantracker/Sources/LoanTracker/ContentView.swift</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<search>Button(\"Load File\") {\n    Task {\n        await viewModel.chooseFile()\n    }\n}\nButton(\"Save As\") {\n    Task {\n        await viewModel.saveAs()\n    }\n}</search>\n<description>Update ContentView to remove Task wrappers for file operations</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\nThese changes should resolve the issue with the app freezing when trying to save or load files.

The issue with the file picker not showing up is likely due to the use of `beginSheetModal(for:)`, which requires a parent window. Let's modify our approach to use `begin(completionHandler:)` instead, which doesn't require a parent window and should work in our SwiftUI environment.\n\nHere's how we can update the `AppViewModel`:\n\n<step>\nUpdate the AppViewModel to use `begin(completionHandler:)` for file operations:\n\n```swift\nimport Combine\nimport SwiftUI\nimport UniformTypeIdentifiers\n\n@MainActor\nclass AppViewModel: ObservableObject {\n    @Published var loan: Loan\n    @Published var monthlyPayment: Double = 0\n    @Published var remainingBalance: Double = 0\n    @Published var warningThreshold: Double = 1000  // Default warning threshold\n    @Published var fileURL: URL?\n\n    private var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()\n\n    init() {\n        self.loan = Loan(\n            amount: 10000, startDate: Date(),\n            endDate: Date().addingTimeInterval(365 * 24 * 60 * 60), lenderCurrency: \"USD\",\n            borrowerCurrency: \"USD\", payments: [])\n        calculateMonthlyPayment()\n        setupBindings()\n    }\n\n    private func setupBindings() {\n        $loan\n            .sink { [weak self] _ in\n                self?.calculateMonthlyPayment()\n                Task { @MainActor in\n                    await self?.saveLoan()\n                }\n            }\n            .store(in: &cancellables)\n    }\n\n    func calculateMonthlyPayment() {\n        let totalMonths =\n            Calendar.current.dateComponents([.month], from: loan.startDate, to: loan.endDate).month\n            ?? 1\n        let totalPaid = loan.payments.reduce(0) { $0 + $1.amount }\n        remainingBalance = loan.amount - totalPaid\n        monthlyPayment = remainingBalance / Double(totalMonths)\n    }\n\n    func addPayment(_ amount: Double) {\n        loan.payments.append(Payment(id: UUID(), amount: amount, date: Date()))\n        calculateMonthlyPayment()\n    }\n\n    func saveLoan() async {\n        guard let url = fileURL else { return }\n        do {\n            try await SecureStorage.shared.save(loan, to: url)\n        } catch {\n            print(\"Failed to save loan: \\(error)\")\n        }\n    }\n\n    func loadLoan(from url: URL) async {\n        do {\n            loan = try await SecureStorage.shared.load(from: url)\n            fileURL = url\n            calculateMonthlyPayment()\n        } catch {\n            print(\"Failed to load loan: \\(error)\")\n        }\n    }\n\n    func chooseFile() async {\n        let panel = NSOpenPanel()\n        panel.allowsMultipleSelection = false\n        panel.canChooseDirectories = false\n        panel.allowedContentTypes = [UTType.data]\n\n        return await withCheckedContinuation { continuation in\n            panel.begin { response in\n                if response == .OK, let url = panel.url {\n                    Task { @MainActor in\n                        await self.loadLoan(from: url)\n                    }\n                }\n                continuation.resume()\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    func saveAs() async {\n        let panel = NSSavePanel()\n        panel.allowedContentTypes = [UTType.data]\n        panel.canCreateDirectories = true\n        panel.isExtensionHidden = false\n        panel.allowsOtherFileTypes = false\n        panel.title = \"Save Loan Data\"\n        panel.message = \"Choose a location to save your loan data\"\n        panel.nameFieldLabel = \"File name:\"\n\n        return await withCheckedContinuation { continuation in\n            panel.begin { response in\n                if response == .OK, let url = panel.url {\n                    self.fileURL = url\n                    Task { @MainActor in\n                        await self.saveLoan()\n                    }\n                }\n                continuation.resume()\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>loantracker/Sources/LoanTracker/AppViewModel.swift</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<search>func chooseFile() async {</search>\n<description>Update AppViewModel to use begin(completionHandler:) for file operations</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\nThis change uses `begin(completionHandler:)` for both the open and save panels, which should work correctly in a SwiftUI environment without requiring a parent window. We're using `withCheckedContinuation` to bridge the callback-based API with Swift's async/await system.\n\nThe ContentView can remain as it was in the previous response:\n\n```swift\nimport SwiftUI\n\nstruct ContentView: View {\n    @StateObject private var viewModel = AppViewModel()\n    @State private var newPaymentAmount: String = \"\"\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack(spacing: 20) {\n            Text(\"Loan Tracker\").font(.largeTitle)\n\n            HStack {\n                Button(\"Load File\") {\n                    Task {\n                        await viewModel.chooseFile()\n                    }\n                }\n                Button(\"Save As\") {\n                    Task {\n                        await viewModel.saveAs()\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            // ... rest of the view remains the same\n        }\n        .padding()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThese changes should resolve the issue with the file picker not showing up. The file dialogs should now appear correctly when the \"Load File\" or \"Save As\" buttons are clicked, and the app should remain responsive during these operations.\nthis change did fuck all\nI apologize for the continued issues. It seems that the problem might be more deeply rooted in how the SwiftUI app is structured. Let's try a different approach using NSViewRepresentable to create a wrapper for NSOpenPanel and NSSavePanel that we can use directly in our SwiftUI view.\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution:\n\n<step>\nFirst, let's create a new file called `FileDialogView.swift` with the following content:\n\n```swift\nimport SwiftUI\n\nstruct FileDialogView: NSViewRepresentable {\n@Binding var isPresented: Bool\nlet dialogType: DialogType\nlet completion: (URL?) -> Void\n\nenum DialogType {\ncase open, save\n}\n\nfunc makeNSView(context: Context) -> NSView {\nNSView()\n}\n\nfunc updateNSView(_ nsView: NSView, context: Context) {\nif isPresented {\nDispatchQueue.main.async {\nswitch dialogType {\ncase .open:\nlet panel = NSOpenPanel()\npanel.allowsMultipleSelection = false\npanel.canChooseDirectories = false\npanel.allowedContentTypes = [.data]\nif panel.runModal() == .OK {\ncompletion(panel.url)\n} else {\ncompletion(nil)\n}\ncase .save:\nlet panel = NSSavePanel()\npanel.allowedContentTypes = [.data]\npanel.canCreateDirectories = true\npanel.isExtensionHidden = false\npanel.allowsOtherFileTypes = false\npanel.title = \"Save Loan Data\"\npanel.message = \"Choose a location to save your loan data\"\npanel.nameFieldLabel = \"File name:\"\nif panel.runModal() == .OK {\ncompletion(panel.url)\n} else {\ncompletion(nil)\n}\n}\nisPresented = false\n}\n}\n}\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>loantracker/Sources/LoanTracker/FileDialogView.swift</path>\n<operation>create</operation>\n<description>Create FileDialogView to handle file dialogs</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nNow, let's update the AppViewModel to use this new approach:\n\n```swift\nimport Combine\nimport SwiftUI\n\n@MainActor\nclass AppViewModel: ObservableObject {\n@Published var loan: Loan\n@Published var monthlyPayment: Double = 0\n@Published var remainingBalance: Double = 0\n@Published var warningThreshold: Double = 1000  // Default warning threshold\n@Published var fileURL: URL?\n@Published var isFileDialogPresented = false\n@Published var fileDialogType: FileDialogView.DialogType = .open\n\nprivate var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()\n\ninit() {\nself.loan = Loan(\namount: 10000, startDate: Date(),\nendDate: Date().addingTimeInterval(365 * 24 * 60 * 60), lenderCurrency: \"USD\",\nborrowerCurrency: \"USD\", payments: [])\ncalculateMonthlyPayment()\nsetupBindings()\n}\n\nprivate func setupBindings() {\n$loan\n.sink { [weak self] _ in\nself?.calculateMonthlyPayment()\nTask { @MainActor in\nawait self?.saveLoan()\n}\n}\n.store(in: &cancellables)\n}\n\nfunc calculateMonthlyPayment() {\nlet totalMonths =\nCalendar.current.dateComponents([.month], from: loan.startDate, to: loan.endDate).month\n??

By using `NSApplication.shared.mainWindow?.beginSheet()`, we're ensuring that the file dialogs are presented as sheets attached to the main window of the application.\n\nThe \"Load File\" and \"Save As\" buttons should now trigger the appropriate file dialogs, and the app should remain responsive during these operations. The file dialogs will be presented as sheets attached to the main window, which is in line with modern macOS app design.\n\nIf you're still experiencing issues, please make sure that:\n\n1. Your app has a proper window (which should be ensured by the WindowGroup in LoanTrackerApp).\n2.
