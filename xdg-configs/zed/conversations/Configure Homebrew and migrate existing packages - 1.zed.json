Each step should describe a high-level change, which can consist of multiple edits to distinct locations in the codebase.\n\n## Output Example\n\nProvide output as XML, with the following format:\n\n<step>\nUpdate the Person struct to store an age\n\n```rust\nstruct Person {\n    // existing fields...\n    age: u8,\n    height: f32,\n    // existing fields...\n}\n\nimpl Person {\n    fn age(&self) -> u8 {\n        self.age\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/person.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_before</operation>\n<search>height: f32,</search>\n<description>Add the age field</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/person.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_after</operation>\n<search>impl Person {</search>\n<description>Add the age getter</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n## Output Format\n\nFirst, each `<step>` must contain a written description of the change that should be made. The description should begin with a high-level overview, and can contain markdown code blocks as well. The description should be self-contained and actionable.\n\nAfter the description, each `<step>` must contain one or more `<edit>` tags, each of which refer to a specific range in a source file. Each `<edit>` tag must contain the following child tags:\n\n### `<path>` (required)\n\nThis tag contains the path to the file that will be changed. It can be an existing path, or a path that should be created.\n\n### `<search>` (optional)\n\nThis tag contains a search string to locate in the source file, e.g. `pub fn baz() {`. If not provided, the new content will be inserted at the top of the file. Make sure to produce a string that exists in the source file and that isn't ambiguous. When there's ambiguity, add more lines to the search to eliminate it.\n\n### `<description>` (required)\n\nThis tag contains a single-line description of the edit that should be made at the given location.\n\n### `<operation>` (required)\n\nThis tag indicates what type of change should be made, relative to the given location. It can be one of the following:\n- `update`: Rewrites the specified string entirely based on the given description.\n- `create`: Creates a new file with the given path based on the provided description.\n- `insert_before`: Inserts new text based on the given description before the specified search string.\n- `insert_after`: Inserts new text based on the given description after the specified search string.\n- `delete`: Deletes the specified string from the containing file.\n\n<guidelines>\n- There's no need to describe *what* to do, just *where* to do it.\n- Only reference locations that actually exist (unless you're creating a file).\n- If creating a file, assume any subsequent updates are included at the time of creation.\n- Don't create and then update a file. Always create new files in one hot.\n- Prefer multiple edits to smaller regions, as opposed to one big edit to a larger region.\n- Don't produce edits that intersect each other. In that case, merge them into a bigger edit.\n- Never nest an edit with another edit. Never include CDATA. All edits are leaf nodes.\n- Descriptions are required for all edits except delete.\n- When generating multiple edits, ensure the descriptions are specific to each individual operation.\n- Avoid referring to the search string in the description. Focus on the change to be made, not the location where it's made. That's implicit with the `search` string you provide.\n- Don't generate multiple edits at the same location. Instead, combine them together in a single edit with a succinct combined description.\n- Always ensure imports are added if you're referencing symbols that are not in scope.\n</guidelines>\n\nHere are some concrete examples.\n\n<example>\n<message role=\"user\">\n\n```rs src/shapes.rs\npub mod rectangle;\npub mod circle;\n```\n\n```rs src/shapes/rectangle.rs\npub struct Rectangle {\n    width: f64,\n    height: f64,\n}\n\nimpl Rectangle {\n    pub fn new(width: f64, height: f64) -> Self {\n        Rectangle { width, height }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```rs src/shapes/circle.rs\npub struct Circle {\n    radius: f64,\n}\n\nimpl Circle {\n    pub fn new(radius: f64) -> Self {\n        Circle { radius }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nUpdate all shapes to store their origin as an (x, y) tuple and implement Display.\n</message>\n\n<message role=\"assistant\">\nWe'll need to update both the rectangle and circle modules.\n\n<step>\nAdd origin fields to both shape types.\n\n```rust\nstruct Rectangle {\n    // existing fields ...\n    origin: (f64, f64),\n}\n```\n\n```rust\nstruct Circle {\n    // existing fields ...\n    origin: (f64, f64),\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/rectangle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_before</operation>\n<search>\n    width: f64,\n    height: f64,\n</search>\n<description>Add the origin field to Rectangle</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/circle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_before</operation>\n<search>\n    radius: f64,\n</search>\n<description>Add the origin field to Circle</description>\n</edit>\n\n<step>\nUpdate both shape's constructors to take an origin.\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/rectangle.rs</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<search>\n    fn new(width: f64, height: f64) -> Self {\n        Rectangle { width, height }\n    }\n</search>\n<description>Update the Rectangle new function to take an origin</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/circle.rs</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<search>\n    fn new(radius: f64) -> Self {\n        Circle { radius }\n    }\n</search>\n<description>Update the Circle new function to take an origin</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nImplement Display for both shapes\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/rectangle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_before</operation>\n<search>\nstruct Rectangle {\n</search>\n<description>Add an import for the `std::fmt` module</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/rectangle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_after</operation>\n<search>\n        Rectangle { width, height }\n    }\n}\n</search>\n<description>Add a Display implementation for Rectangle</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/circle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_before</operation>\n<search>\nstruct Circle {\n</search>\n<description>Add an import for the `std::fmt` module</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/circle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_after</operation>\n<search>\n        Circle { radius }\n    }\n}\n</search>\n<description>Add a Display implementation for Circle</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n</message>\n</example>\n\n<example number=2>\n<message role=\"user\">\n\n```rs src/user.rs\nstruct User {\n    pub name: String,\n    age: u32,\n    email: String,\n}\n\nimpl User {\n    fn new(name: String, age: u32, email: String) -> Self {\n        User { name, age, email }\n    }\n\n    pub fn print_info(&self) {\n        todo!()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nLet's print all the user information and delete the email field.\n</message>\n\n<message role=\"assistant\">\n<step>\nUpdate the 'print_info' method to print user information\n\n```rust\nimpl User {\n    // ... other methods ...\n\n    pub fn print_info(&self) {\n        println!(\"Name: {name}, Age: {age}\", name = self.name, age = self.age);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/user.rs</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<search>\n    pub fn print_info(&self) {\n        todo!()\n    }\n</search>\n<description>Print all the user information</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nRemove the 'email' field from the User struct\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/user.rs</path>\n<operation>delete</operation>\n<search>\nemail: String,\n</search>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/user.rs</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<symbol>\nfn new(name: String, age: u32, email: String) -> Self {\n    User { name, age, email }\n}\n</symbol>\n<description>Remove email parameter from new method</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n</message>\n</example>\n\nYou should think step by step.

I'll guide you through the process of configuring your Nix Darwin flake to use Homebrew and migrate your currently installed packages to it. We'll do this in a series of steps.\n\n<step>\nEnable Homebrew in the Nix Darwin configuration\n\nFirst, we need to enable Homebrew in your Nix Darwin configuration. We'll add the necessary configuration to enable Homebrew and allow it to manage itself.\n\n```nix\n{ pkgs, ... }: {\n  # ... existing configuration ...\n\n  # Enable Homebrew\n  homebrew = {\n    enable = true;\n    onActivation = {\n      autoUpdate = true;\n      cleanup = \"zap\";\n    };\n    global = {\n      brewfile = true;\n    };\n  };\n\n  # ... rest of the configuration ...\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>~/dotfiles/nix/flake.nix</path>\n<operation>insert_before</operation>\n<search>  # List packages installed in system profile. To search by name, run:</search>\n<description>Enable Homebrew and configure its behavior</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nAdd Homebrew packages\n\nNow, let's add the Homebrew packages you want to install. You'll need to list all the packages you currently have installed that you want to migrate to Homebrew. For this example, I'll use a few common packages, but you should replace these with your actual list of packages.\n\n```nix\n{ pkgs, ... }: {\n  # ... existing configuration ...\n\n  homebrew = {\n    # ... existing Homebrew configuration ...\n\n    # Homebrew packages to install\n    brews = [\n      \"wget\"\n      \"git\"\n      \"tree\"\n      \"ripgrep\"\n    ];\n\n    # Homebrew casks to install\n    casks = [\n      \"firefox\"\n      \"visual-studio-code\"\n      \"iterm2\"\n    ];\n  };\n\n  # ... rest of the configuration ...\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>~/dotfiles/nix/flake.nix</path>\n<operation>insert_after</operation>\n<search>  homebrew = {\n    enable = true;\n    onActivation = {\n      autoUpdate = true;\n      cleanup = \"zap\";\n    };\n    global = {\n      brewfile = true;\n    };\n  };</search>\n<description>Add Homebrew packages and casks</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nRemove system packages managed by Nix\n\nSince we're migrating to Homebrew, we should remove the packages that were previously managed by Nix. In this case, we'll remove vim from the `environment.systemPackages` list.\n\n<edit>\n<path>~/dotfiles/nix/flake.nix</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<search>      environment.systemPackages =\n        [ pkgs.vim\n        ];</search>\n<description>Remove Nix-managed packages</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nUpdate the flake inputs to include the Homebrew module\n\nWe need to add the homebrew-nix module to our flake inputs to use Homebrew with nix-darwin.\n\n```nix\n{\n  # inputs = {\n    nixpkgs.url = \"github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable\";\n    nix-darwin.url = \"github:LnL7/nix-darwin\";\n    nix-darwin.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = \"nixpkgs\";\n    homebrew-nix.url = \"github:zhaofengli-wip/homebrew-nix\";\n  };\n\n  # ... rest of the flake ...\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>~/dotfiles/nix/flake.nix</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<search>  inputs = {\n    nixpkgs.url = \"github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable\";\n    nix-darwin.url = \"github:LnL7/nix-darwin\";\n    nix-darwin.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = \"nixpkgs\";\n  };</search>\n<description>Add homebrew-nix to flake inputs</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nUpdate the outputs to use the Homebrew module\n\nFinally, we need to update the outputs to include the Homebrew module in the nix-darwin configuration.\n\n```nix\n  outputs = inputs@{ self, nix-darwin, nixpkgs, homebrew-nix }:\n  let\n    configuration = { pkgs, ... }: {\n      # ... existing configuration ...\n    };\n  in\n  {\n    darwinConfigurations.\"mbpro\" = nix-darwin.lib.darwinSystem {\n      modules = [ \n        configuration\n        homebrew-nix.darwinModules.homebrew\n      ];\n    };\n\n    # ... rest of the outputs ...\n  };\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>~/dotfiles/nix/flake.nix</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<search>  outputs = inputs@{ self, nix-darwin, nixpkgs }:\n  let\n    configuration = { pkgs, ... }: {\n      # List packages installed in system profile.

Remember to replace the example Homebrew packages and casks with the ones you actually want to install.\n\nAfter making these changes, you can rebuild your system using:\n\n```\ndarwin-rebuild switch --flake .#mbpro\n```\n\nThis will apply the new configuration, enabling Homebrew and installing the specified packages through it.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":58}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":37},"start":9673,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":59}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":38},"start":15338,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":60}}}],"summary":"Configure Homebrew and migrate existing packages","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":2,"end":7918},"icon":"Route","label":"Workflow","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":7919,"end":9576},"icon":"File","label":"~/dotfiles/nix/flake.nix","metadata":{"path":"~/dotfiles/nix/flake.nix"}}]}
