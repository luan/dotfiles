Each step should describe a high-level change, which can consist of multiple edits to distinct locations in the codebase.\n\n## Output Example\n\nProvide output as XML, with the following format:\n\n<step>\nUpdate the Person struct to store an age\n\n```rust\nstruct Person {\n    // existing fields...\n    age: u8,\n    height: f32,\n    // existing fields...\n}\n\nimpl Person {\n    fn age(&self) -> u8 {\n        self.age\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/person.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_before</operation>\n<search>height: f32,</search>\n<description>Add the age field</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/person.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_after</operation>\n<search>impl Person {</search>\n<description>Add the age getter</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n## Output Format\n\nFirst, each `<step>` must contain a written description of the change that should be made. The description should begin with a high-level overview, and can contain markdown code blocks as well. The description should be self-contained and actionable.\n\nAfter the description, each `<step>` must contain one or more `<edit>` tags, each of which refer to a specific range in a source file. Each `<edit>` tag must contain the following child tags:\n\n### `<path>` (required)\n\nThis tag contains the path to the file that will be changed. It can be an existing path, or a path that should be created.\n\n### `<search>` (optional)\n\nThis tag contains a search string to locate in the source file, e.g. `pub fn baz() {`. If not provided, the new content will be inserted at the top of the file. Make sure to produce a string that exists in the source file and that isn't ambiguous. When there's ambiguity, add more lines to the search to eliminate it.\n\n### `<description>` (required)\n\nThis tag contains a single-line description of the edit that should be made at the given location.\n\n### `<operation>` (required)\n\nThis tag indicates what type of change should be made, relative to the given location. It can be one of the following:\n- `update`: Rewrites the specified string entirely based on the given description.\n- `create`: Creates a new file with the given path based on the provided description.\n- `insert_before`: Inserts new text based on the given description before the specified search string.\n- `insert_after`: Inserts new text based on the given description after the specified search string.\n- `delete`: Deletes the specified string from the containing file.\n\n<guidelines>\n- There's no need to describe *what* to do, just *where* to do it.\n- Only reference locations that actually exist (unless you're creating a file).\n- If creating a file, assume any subsequent updates are included at the time of creation.\n- Don't create and then update a file. Always create new files in one hot.\n- Prefer multiple edits to smaller regions, as opposed to one big edit to a larger region.\n- Don't produce edits that intersect each other. In that case, merge them into a bigger edit.\n- Never nest an edit with another edit. Never include CDATA. All edits are leaf nodes.\n- Descriptions are required for all edits except delete.\n- When generating multiple edits, ensure the descriptions are specific to each individual operation.\n- Avoid referring to the search string in the description. Focus on the change to be made, not the location where it's made. That's implicit with the `search` string you provide.\n- Don't generate multiple edits at the same location. Instead, combine them together in a single edit with a succinct combined description.\n- Always ensure imports are added if you're referencing symbols that are not in scope.\n</guidelines>\n\nHere are some concrete examples.\n\n<example>\n<message role=\"user\">\n\n```rs src/shapes.rs\npub mod rectangle;\npub mod circle;\n```\n\n```rs src/shapes/rectangle.rs\npub struct Rectangle {\n    width: f64,\n    height: f64,\n}\n\nimpl Rectangle {\n    pub fn new(width: f64, height: f64) -> Self {\n        Rectangle { width, height }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```rs src/shapes/circle.rs\npub struct Circle {\n    radius: f64,\n}\n\nimpl Circle {\n    pub fn new(radius: f64) -> Self {\n        Circle { radius }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nUpdate all shapes to store their origin as an (x, y) tuple and implement Display.\n</message>\n\n<message role=\"assistant\">\nWe'll need to update both the rectangle and circle modules.\n\n<step>\nAdd origin fields to both shape types.\n\n```rust\nstruct Rectangle {\n    // existing fields ...\n    origin: (f64, f64),\n}\n```\n\n```rust\nstruct Circle {\n    // existing fields ...\n    origin: (f64, f64),\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/rectangle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_before</operation>\n<search>\n    width: f64,\n    height: f64,\n</search>\n<description>Add the origin field to Rectangle</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/circle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_before</operation>\n<search>\n    radius: f64,\n</search>\n<description>Add the origin field to Circle</description>\n</edit>\n\n<step>\nUpdate both shape's constructors to take an origin.\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/rectangle.rs</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<search>\n    fn new(width: f64, height: f64) -> Self {\n        Rectangle { width, height }\n    }\n</search>\n<description>Update the Rectangle new function to take an origin</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/circle.rs</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<search>\n    fn new(radius: f64) -> Self {\n        Circle { radius }\n    }\n</search>\n<description>Update the Circle new function to take an origin</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nImplement Display for both shapes\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/rectangle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_before</operation>\n<search>\nstruct Rectangle {\n</search>\n<description>Add an import for the `std::fmt` module</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/rectangle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_after</operation>\n<search>\n        Rectangle { width, height }\n    }\n}\n</search>\n<description>Add a Display implementation for Rectangle</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/circle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_before</operation>\n<search>\nstruct Circle {\n</search>\n<description>Add an import for the `std::fmt` module</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/circle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_after</operation>\n<search>\n        Circle { radius }\n    }\n}\n</search>\n<description>Add a Display implementation for Circle</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n</message>\n</example>\n\n<example number=2>\n<message role=\"user\">\n\n```rs src/user.rs\nstruct User {\n    pub name: String,\n    age: u32,\n    email: String,\n}\n\nimpl User {\n    fn new(name: String, age: u32, email: String) -> Self {\n        User { name, age, email }\n    }\n\n    pub fn print_info(&self) {\n        todo!()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nLet's print all the user information and delete the email field.\n</message>\n\n<message role=\"assistant\">\n<step>\nUpdate the 'print_info' method to print user information\n\n```rust\nimpl User {\n    // ... other methods ...\n\n    pub fn print_info(&self) {\n        println!(\"Name: {name}, Age: {age}\", name = self.name, age = self.age);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/user.rs</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<search>\n    pub fn print_info(&self) {\n        todo!()\n    }\n</search>\n<description>Print all the user information</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nRemove the 'email' field from the User struct\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/user.rs</path>\n<operation>delete</operation>\n<search>\nemail: String,\n</search>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/user.rs</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<symbol>\nfn new(name: String, age: u32, email: String) -> Self {\n    User { name, age, email }\n}\n</symbol>\n<description>Remove email parameter from new method</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n</message>\n</example>\n\nYou should think step by step. When possible, produce smaller, coherent logical steps as opposed to one big step that combines lots of heterogeneous edits.\n\n</task_description>\n\nLet's start a new macOS project called browser. It should be in Swift using SwiftUI. I'd also like to Chromium as a base for the browser.\nCompiling should be possible from the command line, not requiring one to open Xcode.\nCertainly! I'll guide you through the process of setting up a new macOS project called \"browser\" using Swift and SwiftUI, incorporating Chromium as the base for the browser engine. We'll also ensure that the project can be compiled from the command line without requiring Xcode. Let's break this down into steps:\n\n<step>\nCreate the project structure and initial Swift package\n\nFirst, we'll create a new Swift package for our browser project.\n\n```bash\nmkdir browser\ncd browser\nswift package init --type executable\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>browser/Package.swift</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<search>// swift-tools-version:5.5\n// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.\n\nimport PackageDescription\n\nlet package = Package(\n    name: \"browser\",\n    dependencies: [\n        // Dependencies declare other packages that this package depends on.\n        // .package(url: /* package url */, from: \"1.0.0\"),\n    ],\n    targets: [\n        // Targets are the basic building blocks of a package. A target can define a module or a test suite.\n        // Targets can depend on other targets in this package, and on products in packages this package depends on.\n        .executableTarget(\n            name: \"browser\",\n            dependencies: []),\n        .testTarget(\n            name: \"browserTests\",\n            dependencies: [\"browser\"]),\n    ]\n)\n</search>\n<description>Update Package.swift with SwiftUI dependency</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nSet up the main SwiftUI application structure\n\nNow, let's create the main SwiftUI application structure.\n\n<edit>\n<path>browser/Sources/browser/BrowserApp.swift</path>\n<operation>create</operation>\n<description>Create the main SwiftUI application file</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>browser/Sources/browser/ContentView.swift</path>\n<operation>create</operation>\n<description>Create the main content view for the browser</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nIntegrate Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)\n\nTo use Chromium as the base for our browser, we'll need to integrate the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF). This involves several sub-steps:\n\n1. Download CEF for macOS\n2. Set up the framework in our project\n3. Create a bridge between Swift and CEF (which is in C++)\n\nFirst, let's add a script to download and set up CEF:\n\n<edit>\n<path>browser/setup_cef.sh</path>\n<operation>create</operation>\n<description>Create a script to download and set up CEF</description>\n</edit>\n\nNow, let's create a C++ wrapper for CEF that we can bridge to Swift:\n\n<edit>\n<path>browser/Sources/CEFWrapper/include/CEFWrapper.h</path>\n<operation>create</operation>\n<description>Create the header file for the CEF wrapper</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>browser/Sources/CEFWrapper/CEFWrapper.cpp</path>\n<operation>create</operation>\n<description>Create the implementation file for the CEF wrapper</description>\n</edit>\n\nFinally, let's create a Swift file to bridge with our C++ wrapper:\n\n<edit>\n<path>browser/Sources/browser/CEFBridge.swift</path>\n<operation>create</operation>\n<description>Create a Swift bridge to the CEF wrapper</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nUpdate Package.swift to include CEF wrapper\n\nWe need to update our Package.swift file to include the CEF wrapper as a target.\n\n<edit>\n<path>browser/Package.swift</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<search>let package = Package(\n    name: \"browser\",\n    platforms: [.macOS(.v11)],\n    dependencies: [\n        // Dependencies declare other packages that this package depends on.\n        // .package(url: /* package url */, from: \"1.0.0\"),\n    ],\n    targets: [\n        // Targets are the basic building blocks of a package. A target can define a module or a test suite.\n        // Targets can depend on other targets in this package, and on products in packages this package depends on.\n        .executableTarget(\n            name: \"browser\",\n            dependencies: []),\n        .testTarget(\n            name: \"browserTests\",\n            dependencies: [\"browser\"]),\n    ]\n)</search>\n<description>Update Package.swift to include CEF wrapper target</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nCreate a Makefile for command-line compilation\n\nTo enable command-line compilation without Xcode, we'll create a Makefile:\n\n<edit>\n<path>browser/Makefile</path>\n<operation>create</operation>\n<description>Create a Makefile for command-line compilation</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\nThis setup provides a foundation for your macOS browser project using Swift, SwiftUI, and Chromium (via CEF). You can now build and run the project from the command line using `make`. Remember to run the `setup_cef.sh` script before attempting to build the project for the first time.\n\nThe next steps would involve implementing the browser functionality using the CEF wrapper and creating the user interface with SwiftUI. Would you like me to continue with those aspects?\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":90}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":65},"start":8143,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":88}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":66},"start":13035,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":89}}}],"summary":"New macOS SwiftUI Browser Project with Chromium","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":7919},"icon":"Route","label":"Workflow","metadata":null}]}
