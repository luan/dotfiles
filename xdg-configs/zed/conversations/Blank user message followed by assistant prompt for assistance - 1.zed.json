The `material.counts` seems to denote the number of sprites in the atlas along the x and y dimensions, with `material.index` indicating the specific sprite you're trying to render.\n\nWhen calculating UV coordinates for a sprite in an atlas, you'll calculate the 'base' top-left UV coordinate of the sprite in the atlas, then use that to adjust each UV point within the sprite to get the correct texture sample.\n\nThe `uv_offset` function is intended to compute the correct UV offset for a sprite within the atlas based on its index, but there seems to be a problem because it incorrectly handles the Y coordinate when calculating the row the sprite is on. It divides the index by the number of rows, instead of the number of columns.\n\nHere's an updated version of the `uv_offset` function that corrects for this issue:\n\n```wgsl\nfn uv_offset(offset: vec2<f32>, uv: vec2<f32>) -> vec2<f32> {\n    let columns = material.counts.x;\n    let rows = material.counts.y;\n\n    // Calculate the integer column and row number for the sprite based on its index\n    let column = f32(material.index % u32(columns));\n    let row = f32(material.index / u32(columns));\n\n    // Calculate the UV offset for the current sprite within the atlas\n    let uvx = uv.x / columns + (column + offset.x) / columns;\n    let uvy = uv.y / rows + (row + offset.y) / rows;\n\n    return vec2(uvx, uvy);\n}\n```\n\nThe above function adjusts the division to ensure you're dividing by the correct number of columns to get the row number. Additionally, it divides `uv.x` and `uv.y` by `columns` and `rows` respectively to scale the per-sprite UV to the appropriate size within the atlas.\n\nAnother potential issue in your original code is the handling of the outline effect. When sampling around the `cuv` for the outline effect, you should ensure that the additional `thickness` offset doesn't cause you to sample outside the assigned sprite region. You may need to adjust your `pixel` and outline effect logic to apply within the allocated UV space for the sprite, or you may need additional clamp logic to make sure not to overshoot the sprite's bounds. If your thickness value causes you to sample outside of your sprite rectangle, you'll need to ensure that the region around each sprite in the atlas texture has transparent pixels to avoid bleeding from adjacent sprites.\nhow can I adjust pixel function to sample only the current sprite in the atlas?\nTo restrict the sampling to only the current sprite in the atlas, you need to make sure that your sampling coordinates are clamped within the sprite's boundaries. These boundaries are determined by the 'base' UV coordinates for the sprite and its size, which is inversely proportional to the number of sprites along each axis in the atlas texture (`material.counts.x` and `material.counts.y`).\n\nHere is an example of how you could modify the `pixel` function to include clamping:\n\n```wgsl\nfn pixel(offset: vec2<f32>, uv: vec2<f32>, adjustment: vec2<f32>) -> vec4<f32> {\n    let base_uv = uv_offset(offset, vec2<f32>(0, 0));\n\n    // Calculate adjusted UV coordinates\n    let uv_adjusted = uv_offset(offset, uv) + adjustment;\n\n    // Calculate UV boundaries for the sprite\n    let min_uv = base_uv;\n    let max_uv = min_uv + vec2<f32>(1.0 / material.counts.x, 1.0 / material.counts.y);\n\n    // Clamp the adjusted UV coordinates within the boundaries of the sprite\n    let clamped_uv = clamp(uv_adjusted, min_uv, max_uv);\n\n    // Sample the texture using the clamped UV coordinates\n    return get_sample(clamped_uv);\n}\n```\n\nIn this update, `base_uv` denotes the 'base' UV coordinates of the sprite within the atlas (its top-left corner), and then we calculate `max_uv` which represents the bottom-right corner of the sprite. With these two points, we can define the boundaries of the current sprite, and we make sure that `uv_adjusted`, which is the UV we wish to sample, is clamped within these boundaries.\n\nThe `clamp` function ensures that the `uv_adjusted` coordinates do not go outside the sprite's UV space. This way, if your `adjustment` for the outline would move the sample outside of the sprite's area, the clamp operation will restrict it to the edge of the sprite instead of sampling the adjacent sprite in the atlas.\n\nThis should prevent the outline from incorporating parts of other sprites or textures outside of the intended area.\n\nThis is almost perfect, some sprites are still being sampled from the adjacent sprites. How can I fix this?\nIf you are still experiencing outline bleeding with the clamped UVs, this is often due to filtering at the texture edges when the texture sampler interpolates between the edge of your sprite and the adjacent sprites in the texture atlas.\n\nTo prevent this, you could add some padding or a transparent border around each sprite in the texture atlas, or you could adjust the UV coordinates you are using to sample the texture to inset them slightly from the edges of the sprite. By doing the latter, you effectively create a barrier where no interpolation can occur between adjacent sprites.\n\nHere's an approach you might take to inset the UVs within the `pixel` function:\n\n```wgsl\nfn pixel(offset: vec2<f32>, uv: vec2<f32>, adjustment: vec2<f32>, inset: f32) -> vec4<f32> {\n    let base_uv = uv_offset(offset, vec2<f32>(0, 0));\n\n    // Calculate inset boundaries for the sprite to avoid texture bleeding\n    let sprite_size = vec2<f32>(1.0 / material.counts.x, 1.0 / material.counts.y);\n    let min_uv = base_uv + vec2<f32>(inset) * sprite_size;\n    let max_uv = base_uv + sprite_size - vec2<f32>(inset) * sprite_size;\n\n    // Calculate adjusted UV coordinates\n    let uv_adjusted = uv_offset(offset, uv) + adjustment;\n\n    // Clamp the adjusted UV coordinates within the inset boundaries of the sprite\n    let clamped_uv = clamp(uv_adjusted, min_uv, max_uv);\n\n    // Sample the texture using the clamped UV coordinates\n    return get_sample(clamped_uv);\n}\n\n// ...\n\n@fragment\nfn fragment(\n    in: VertexOutput,\n) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {\n    // ...\n\n    // Use a small inset to avoid sampling the borders\n    let inset = 0.01; // 1% inset\n\n    // Now pass this inset value to your pixel function\n    var outline : f32 = pixel(vec2(0., 0.), cuv, vec2(thickness, 0.), inset).a;\n    // ... continue with other `pixel` calls, each with the `inset` parameter\n\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nAdjust the `inset` value based on your atlas layout and the precision you need. Setting it as a small percentage of the sprite size will prevent sampling at the very edge where linear filtering could blend pixels from adjacent sprites. The exact value may depend on your texture atlas layout, the size of the padding between sprites, and the resolution of your texture.\n\nIf this adjustment doesn't suffice, consider reviewing your texture atlas to ensure there is adequate transparent spacing between sprites. Adding padding in the atlas layout phase is generally the most robust way to prevent such bleeding, as it accounts for any filtering the GPU might perform at the texture edges.\nVery good! The only problem now is that the outline is still constrained to the sprite's UV space. How can I make the outline extend beyond the sprite's boundaries? (it is supposed to extend beyond the sprite's UV space after all)\nTo allow the outline to extend beyond the sprite's UV space while still not sampling from adjacent sprites in the atlas, you can use a technique often referred to as an edge detection shader or outline shader. You would sample from the sprite's texture to determine where the alpha channel transitions from opaque to transparent and then render the outline based on those transition points.\n\nFor this approach, you need to first establish that your sprites contain an alpha channel that defines their shape cleanly (often a cutout or alpha-tested region). The outline shader generally works like this:\n\n1. Sample the alpha channel of the sprite at multiple points around the current pixel to determine if it is at an edge (based on alpha threshold).\n2. If the current pixel is an edge, render the outline color; otherwise, render the sprite as usual.\n\nHere's an example of how you might update your fragment shader to achieve this:\n\n```wgsl\n@fragment\nfn fragment(\n    in: VertexOutput,\n) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {\n    let uv = in.uv;\n    let sprite_size = vec2<f32>(1.0 / material.counts.x, 1.0 / material.counts.y);\n    let base_uv = uv_offset(vec2<f32>(0.0), uv);\n\n    // Sample the center texture (the sprite itself).\n    let center = get_sample(base_uv);\n\n    // Set up the thickness of the outline in UV coordinates.\n    let outline_thickness_uv = vec2<f32>(thickness) * sprite_size;\n    \n    // Detect the outline based on alpha value transitions.\n    var outline_alpha : f32 = 0.0;\n\n    // Sample around the center to check for edges\n    outline_alpha += get_sample(base_uv + vec2<f32>(outline_thickness_uv.x, 0.0)).a;\n    outline_alpha += get_sample(base_uv - vec2<f32>(outline_thickness_uv.x, 0.0)).a;\n    outline_alpha += get_sample(base_uv + vec2<f32>(0.0, outline_thickness_uv.y)).a;\n    outline_alpha += get_sample(base_uv - vec2<f32>(0.0, outline_thickness_uv.y)).a;\n    outline_alpha += get_sample(base_uv + outline_thickness_uv).a;\n    outline_alpha += get_sample(base_uv - outline_thickness_uv).a;\n    outline_alpha += get_sample(base_uv + vec2<f32>(outline_thickness_uv.x, -outline_thickness_uv.y)).a;\n    outline_alpha += get_sample(base_uv - vec2<f32>(outline_thickness_uv.x, -outline_thickness_uv.y)).a;\n    \n    // Threshold to determine if the pixel is at an edge (assuming center pixel is not transparent).\n    let alpha_threshold : f32 = 0.5;\n    let is_edge = outline_alpha < (8.0 * alpha_threshold) && center.a > alpha_threshold;\n\n    // If we're on an edge, the outline should show, otherwise, show the original sprite color.\n    let final_color = is_edge ? vec4<f32>(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0) : center;\n\n    return final_color;\n}\n```\n\nIn this shader, `outline_thickness_uv` represents the outline thickness in texture UV coordinates relative to the size of the sprite in the atlas. This makes sure that it scales with the size of the sprites in the atlas for consistency.\n\nThe variable `alpha_threshold` represents the minimum alpha value that will be considered as part of the sprite (as opposed to transparency), and `is_edge` is a boolean indicator to determine whether the current pixel is part of the outline.\n\nIf the alpha summation `outline_alpha` is less than 8 multiplied by the `alpha_threshold` (because we're adding up alpha values from 8 different samples), this suggests we're at an edge, provided that the center pixel itself has a sufficient alpha value (`center.a > alpha_threshold`). If we're at an edge, we set the pixel color to the outline color; otherwise, we just use the sprite's own color.\n\nThis is quite a simple approach, and depending on your specific needs and setup, it may require some tweaking. However, it demonstrates the basic idea of how to produce an outline that can extend beyond the UV bounds of the sprite without sampling the adjacent sprites in the atlas.\n\nKeep in mind that if your sprites are tightly packed in the atlas without padding, you may still get some unwanted artifacts. To completely avoid such issues, adding padding around each sprite in your atlas is the best solution. The padding area should be transparent and large enough to accommodate the outline width without overlapping adjacent sprites.\nTernary isn't valid wgsl syntax. You should use `if` and `else` instead. — user1118321 Dec 14, 2021 at 20:47\nYou are correct, I apologize for the oversight. In WGSL, ternary operators are not valid syntax. Instead, you should use `if` and `else` statements. Let's rewrite the section of the shader where we decide to render the outline or the original sprite color using an `if` statement:\n\n```wgsl\n@fragment\nfn fragment(\n    in: VertexOutput,\n) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {\n    // ... other shader code ...\n\n    // If we're on an edge, the outline should show, otherwise, show the original sprite color.\n    var final_color: vec4<f32>;\n    if (is_edge) {\n        final_color = vec4<f32>(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0); // Outline color.\n    } else {\n        final_color = center; // Original sprite color.\n    }\n\n    return final_color;\n}\n```\n\nIn this modification, `is_edge` is still the boolean result from the outline detection logic, as defined in the earlier shader code. If `is_edge` is true, we set the `final_color` to the outline color; otherwise, we use the color sampled from the center of the sprite.\nThis isn't working as an atlas anymore; now it's just showing the entire spritesheet all messy.\nI apologize for the confusion earlier. To ensure the outline goes beyond the sprite's boundaries, we need to consider a few factors:\n\n1. Padding: Ensure that there is transparent space (padding) around each sprite in the atlas, so we can extend the outline into this space without sampling other sprites.\n   \n2. Outline Sampling: Adjust the outline sampling logic to respect the fact that it can't extend indefinitely due to the atlas's layout constraints. \n\nHere is a strategy where you use a separate atlas or texture for the outline, which contains the precomputed outlines for each sprite:\n\n1. Create an outline texture atlas:\n   - Use image editing software or a script to generate an outline for each sprite and arrange it into a second atlas, matching the layout of the original sprite atlas. Ensure that the outline atlas has transparent padding around each outline.\n   - An alternative is to create the outlines in the shader dynamically and store the precalculated outlines in a separate framebuffer texture or render target that gets updated only when necessary (e.g., when the source atlas changes).\n\n2. Update the rendering logic:\n   - Load both the original sprite atlas and the outline atlas as textures.\n   - In the shader, use the outline atlas texture to sample the outline and blend it with the original sprite from the sprite atlas based on the alpha value of the outline.\n\nHere's a conceptual example using two textures, one for sprites (`texture`) and one for outlines (`outline_texture`):\n\n```wgsl\n// Outline texture and sampler\n@group(2) @binding(3)\nvar outline_texture: texture_2d<f32>;\n@group(2) @binding(4)\nvar outline_texture_sampler: sampler;\n\n@fragment\nfn fragment(\n    in: VertexOutput,\n) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {\n    // Calculate the sprite's base UVs as before\n    let base_uv = uv_offset(vec2<f32>(0.0), uv);\n\n    // Sample the sprite from the atlas\n    let sprite_color = textureSample(texture, texture_sampler, base_uv);\n\n    // Sample the outline (from the second outline atlas)\n    let outline_color = textureSample(outline_texture, outline_texture_sampler, base_uv);\n\n    // Combine the sprite color and the outline based on the outline alpha\n    var final_color: vec4<f32> = sprite_color;\n    if (outline_color.a > 0.0) {\n        // Overlay the outline color onto the sprite color\n        final_color.rgb = mix(sprite_color.rgb, outline_color.rgb, outline_color.a);\n        final_color.a = max(sprite_color.a, outline_color.a); // Ensure visibility of the outline\n    }\n\n    // Correct blend for premultiplied alpha if necessary\n    final_color.rgb *= final_color.a;\n\n    return final_color;\n}\n```\n\nThis approach separates the responsibility of rendering the sprite from rendering the outline. The outline atlas contains precomputed outlines with appropriate padding. When you render the sprite, you sample both the regular texture (for the sprite itself) and the outline texture. You then combine them in the fragment shader, which allows the outline to visually extend beyond the sprite's boundaries without affecting other sprites in the atlas.\n```wgsl\n#import bevy_sprite::mesh2d_view_bindings::globals\nstruct SpriteMaterial {\n    index: u32,\n    counts: vec2<f32>,\n};\n@group(2) @binding(0)\nvar<uniform> material: SpriteMaterial;\n@group(2) @binding(1)\nvar texture: texture_2d<f32>;\n@group(2) @binding(2)\nvar texture_sampler: sampler;\n\n\nfn get_sample(\n    probe: vec2<f32>\n) -> vec4<f32> {\n    return textureSample(texture, texture_sampler, probe);\n}\n\n#import bevy_pbr::forward_io::VertexOutput\n@fragment\nfn fragment(\n    in: VertexOutput,\n) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {\n    let position = in.position;\n    let uv = in.uv;\n    let ux = uv.x / material.counts.x;\n    let uy = uv.y / material.counts.y;\n    let cuv = vec2(ux, uy);\n    let thickness = 0.001;\n\n    let base = pixel(vec2(0., 0.), cuv, vec2(0., 0.));\n\n    var outline : f32 = pixel(vec2(0., 0.), cuv, vec2(thickness, 0.)).a;\n    outline += pixel(vec2(0., 0.), cuv, vec2(-thickness, 0.)).a;\n    outline += pixel(vec2(0., 0.), cuv, vec2(0., thickness)).a;\n    outline += pixel(vec2(0., 0.), cuv, vec2(0., -thickness)).a;\n    outline += pixel(vec2(0., 0.), cuv, vec2(thickness, -thickness)).a;\n    outline += pixel(vec2(0., 0.), cuv, vec2(-thickness, thickness)).a;\n    outline += pixel(vec2(0., 0.), cuv, vec2(thickness, thickness)).a;\n    outline += pixel(vec2(0., 0.), cuv, vec2(-thickness, -thickness)).a;\n    outline = min(outline, 1.);\n\n    return mix(base, vec4<f32>(1., 0., 0., 1.), outline - base.a);\n}\n\nfn pixel(offset: vec2<f32>, uv: vec2<f32>, adjustment: vec2<f32>) -> vec4<f32> {\n    let base_uv = uv_offset(offset, vec2<f32>(0, 0));\n    // Use a small inset to avoid sampling the borders\n    let inset = 0.001;\n\n    // Calculate inset boundaries for the sprite to avoid texture bleeding\n    let sprite_size = vec2<f32>(1.0 / material.counts.x, 1.0 / material.counts.y);\n    let min_uv = base_uv + vec2<f32>(inset) * sprite_size;\n    let max_uv = base_uv + sprite_size - vec2<f32>(inset) * sprite_size;\n\n    // Calculate adjusted UV coordinates\n    let uv_adjusted = uv_offset(offset, uv) + adjustment;\n\n    // Clamp the adjusted UV coordinates within the inset boundaries of the sprite\n    let clamped_uv = clamp(uv_adjusted, min_uv, max_uv);\n\n    // Sample the texture using the clamped UV coordinates\n    return get_sample(clamped_uv);\n}\n\nfn uv_offset(offset: vec2<f32>, uv: vec2<f32>) -> vec2<f32> {\n    let uvx = uv.x + (f32(material.index % u32(material.counts.x)) + offset.x) / material.counts.x;\n    let uvy = uv.y + (f32(material.index / u32(material.counts.y)) + offset.y) / material.counts.y;\n    return vec2(uvx, uvy);\n}\n\n```\n\nlet's take this version of the shader. I've increased the mesh to be twice as big, but I still want to only render the half part down the center, is that possible?\nIf you have increased the mesh to be twice as big and you want to render the sprite to fill the central half portion of the mesh, you'll need to adjust the UV coordinates in the shader accordingly. The goal will be to map the UV coordinates such that only the middle section of the increased mesh is covered by the sprite texture.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Modify the UV mapping in the `uv_offset` function to account for the increased size of the mesh.\n2. Scale the UV coordinates so that the texture only covers the central half portion of the mesh.\n\nAssuming your mesh's dimensions have been doubled, and you want to render the sprite in the center, your UV coordinates should be scaled and translated accordingly:\n\n```wgsl\nfn uv_offset(offset: vec2<f32>, uv: vec2<f32>) -> vec2<f32> {\n    // Get the column and row for the sprite within the atlas\n    let column = f32(material.index % u32(material.counts.x));\n    let row = f32(material.index / u32(material.counts.x));\n    let sprite_size = vec2<f32>(1.0 / material.counts.x, 1.0 / material.counts.y);\n\n    // Adjust the UV coordinates to target the central half region in the increased mesh size\n    // Transform UV from [0, 1] to [0.25, 0.75] range horizontally and vertically \n    let uv_transformed = uv * 0.5 + 0.25;\n    \n    // Calculate final UV coordinates within the sprite's UV space\n    let uvx = uv_transformed.x * sprite_size.x + (column + offset.x) * sprite_size.x;\n    let uvy = uv_transformed.y * sprite_size.y + (row + offset.y) * sprite_size.y;\n\n    return vec2(uvx, uvy);\n}\n```\n\nIn `uv_offset`, `uv_transformed` is calculated by scaling the original `uv` by 0.5 and then adding 0.25. This maps the original [0, 1] UV range to [0.25, 0.75], effectively focusing on the central half portion of the mesh.\n\nAdditionally, when calling the `pixel` function during outline calculation in the `fragment` function, ensure that you use the `in.uv` values provided to the shader:\n\n```wgsl\n@fragment\nfn fragment(\n    in: VertexOutput,\n) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {\n    // Utilize the adjusted uv_offset function\n    // Calculate the central half UV for the sprite\n    let adjusted_uv = uv_offset(vec2<f32>(0.0), in.uv);\n    let base = get_sample(adjusted_uv);\n\n    // Outline code goes here...\n    // Make sure to call 'pixel' with 'adjusted_uv' for the base UV coordinates\n\n    // Return the final color, which would be either the sprite color or the outline\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nNow, when you render the mesh, only the central half portion will be covered by the sprite texture. The `uv_offset` function takes care of scaling and translating the UVs to target the intended area. The rest of the mesh beyond the bounds of the sprite will be transparent if your texture has an alpha channel and your blend mode is set up to discard the transparent pixels.\nThis didn't quite work, I ended up with extremely large \"pixels\" on the resulting render.\nI apologize for the misunderstanding. If your rendering mesh has doubled in size, and you aim to only render the sprite down the center, then you'll need to account for this by transforming the UV coordinates in the fragment shader. This requires scaling and translating the UV coordinates in such a way that they map to the center of the enlarged mesh. Since you want to maintain the original sprite size, we will not scale up the sprite, but simply reposition the UV coordinates to fit in the center.\n\nHere's a revised approach that should give you the correct result:\n\n```wgsl\n@fragment\nfn fragment(\n    in: VertexOutput,\n) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {\n    // Offset to center the sprite in the enlarged mesh.\n    let mesh_scale_offset = vec2<f32>(0.5, 0.0);\n\n    // Calculate UV coordinates for the center of the enlarged mesh.\n    let centered_uv = in.uv - mesh_scale_offset;\n\n    // We only render when the UV coordinates are in the [0.25, 0.75] x [0, 1] range.\n    // This assumes the bottom center of the mesh.\n    if (centered_uv.x < 0.25 || centered_uv.x > 0.75) {\n        discard; // Skip rendering for the fragment outside the desired central area.\n    }\n\n    // Your existing code to compute the base UV and pixel outline.\n    let uv = uv_offset(vec2<f32>(0, 0), centered_uv);\n    let base = get_sample(uv);\n\n    // ... existing outline computation using updated 'uv' ...\n\n    // Use the computed 'base' and 'outline' to the return final color.\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe `mesh_scale_offset` vector centers the texture on the x-axis, assuming that you doubled the mesh size along the x-axis. The `if` statement makes use of the `discard` operation to ignore fragments outside the [0.25, 0.75] x [0, 1] range along the x-axis, effectively masking the sprite rendering to the lower center of the enlarged mesh.\n\nPlease note that this example assumes the UVs provided to the shader are in a [0, 1] range, and the sprite is centered at the bottom of the enlarged mesh. Depending on your project setup, you may need to adjust the `mesh_scale_offset` and the conditions in the `if` statement to match the intended positioning.\n\nLastly, be sure that your `uv_offset` and other shader functions are aware of how the UVs are being transformed so that they work with the centered UVs, and continue to use these newly calculated UVs for operations like sampling and outline adjustments.\nthe center is 0,0 \nIf the center is at the origin `0,0` in the normalized device coordinates, you would typically offset your UVs to the center and then scale them down to fit the sprite in the intended area. For a mesh that has been doubled in size, the UVs will go from -1 to 1 in both the x and y dimensions. To confine the sprite to the center half along the x-axis and maintain full height along the y-axis, you need to adjust the UVs accordingly.\n\nHere's an updated fragment shader that takes into account the position:\n\n```wgsl\n@fragment\nfn fragment(\n    in: VertexOutput,\n) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {\n    // Keep the sprite the same size, but map it to the center of the mesh.\n    // We adjust UVs from [-1, 1] to [0, 1] and take the central part along the x-axis\n    let centered_uv = (in.position.xy + vec2<f32>(1.0, 0.0)) * vec2<f32>(0.5, 1.0);\n    // Only render the sprite if we're in the center half along the x-axis\n    if (centered_uv.x < 0.25 || centered_uv.x > 0.75) {\n        discard; // Discard fragments outside the central region on the x-axis\n    }\n\n    // Now we need to adjust 'centered_uv.x' to the range of [0, 1]\n    // Since we're considering 0.25 - 0.75 as the center region, map it back to [0, 1]\n    // This is effectively a remap from [0.25, 0.75] to [0, 1]\n    let uv = vec2<f32>((centered_uv.x - 0.25) * 2.0, centered_uv.y);\n    \n    // Now use 'uv' to fetch the correct texture sample using your atlas logic\n    let base_uv = uv_offset(vec2<f32>(0.0, 0.0), uv);\n\n    let base_color = get_sample(base_uv);\n\n    // Construct and apply your outline here...\n\n    // Return the base or outline-modified color\n    return base_color;\n}\n```\n\nKeep in mind that when working with double-sized meshes and wanting to place sprites at specific places, the UVs or positions might be provided in different ranges depending on how your engine or renderer sets up the vertex data. The calculation shows an approach that should work with normalized device coordinates scaling from -1 to 1, but you might need to modify the coordinates and conditional logic to fit your actual setup.\n\nIn the example provided, I ensured that the vertex shader would output the necessary transformed coordinates to the fragment shader, or, alternatively, you should adjust the vertex data accordingly before it is sent to the shader.\n","messages":[{"id":0,"start":0},{"id":3,"start":1867},{"id":4,"start":2143},{"id":5,"start":4611},{"id":6,"start":4691},{"id":7,"start":6635},{"id":8,"start":6744},{"id":9,"start":9305},{"id":12,"start":9536},{"id":13,"start":13717},{"id":14,"start":13828},{"id":15,"start":14821},{"id":16,"start":14917},{"id":17,"start":18008},{"id":19,"start":20737},{"id":20,"start":23564},{"id":21,"start":23654},{"id":22,"start":26037},{"id":23,"start":26056},{"id":24,"start":28371}],"message_metadata":{"5":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:01:47.327255-07:00","status":"Done"},"19":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:20:46.944384-07:00","status":"Done"},"20":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:20:46.945083-07:00","status":"Done"},"23":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:27:25.081841-07:00","status":"Done"},"6":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:02:57.643145-07:00","status":"Done"},"21":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:22:48.795535-07:00","status":"Done"},"9":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:04:36.054243-07:00","status":"Done"},"16":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:12:28.005435-07:00","status":"Done"},"7":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:02:57.643452-07:00","status":"Done"},"18":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:20:16.164097-07:00","status":"Done"},"17":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:12:28.005821-07:00","status":"Done"},"22":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:22:48.796489-07:00","status":"Done"},"13":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:07:10.061312-07:00","status":"Done"},"12":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:07:10.060917-07:00","status":"Done"},"0":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:00:35.262714-07:00","status":"Done"},"3":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:01:07.057538-07:00","status":"Done"},"4":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:01:47.326747-07:00","status":"Done"},"15":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:09:10.176724-07:00","status":"Done"},"2":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:00:41.605999-07:00","status":"Done"},"11":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:06:38.461326-07:00","status":"Done"},"1":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:00:41.605599-07:00","status":"Done"},"10":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:06:38.131272-07:00","status":"Done"},"14":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:09:10.176198-07:00","status":"Done"},"24":{"role":"user","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:27:25.082657-07:00","status":"Done"},"8":{"role":"assistant","sent_at":"2024-03-18T22:04:36.053835-07:00","status":"Done"}},"summary":"Blank user message followed by assistant prompt for assistance","api_url":"https://api.openai.com/v1","model":"gpt-4-1106-preview"}
