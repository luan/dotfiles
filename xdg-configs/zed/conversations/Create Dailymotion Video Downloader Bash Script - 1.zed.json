Each step should describe a high-level change, which can consist of multiple edits to distinct locations in the codebase.\n\n## Output Example\n\nProvide output as XML, with the following format:\n\n<step>\nUpdate the Person struct to store an age\n\n```rust\nstruct Person {\n    // existing fields...\n    age: u8,\n    height: f32,\n    // existing fields...\n}\n\nimpl Person {\n    fn age(&self) -> u8 {\n        self.age\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/person.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_before</operation>\n<search>height: f32,</search>\n<description>Add the age field</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/person.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_after</operation>\n<search>impl Person {</search>\n<description>Add the age getter</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n## Output Format\n\nFirst, each `<step>` must contain a written description of the change that should be made. The description should begin with a high-level overview, and can contain markdown code blocks as well. The description should be self-contained and actionable.\n\nAfter the description, each `<step>` must contain one or more `<edit>` tags, each of which refer to a specific range in a source file. Each `<edit>` tag must contain the following child tags:\n\n### `<path>` (required)\n\nThis tag contains the path to the file that will be changed. It can be an existing path, or a path that should be created.\n\n### `<search>` (optional)\n\nThis tag contains a search string to locate in the source file, e.g. `pub fn baz() {`. If not provided, the new content will be inserted at the top of the file. Make sure to produce a string that exists in the source file and that isn't ambiguous. When there's ambiguity, add more lines to the search to eliminate it.\n\n### `<description>` (required)\n\nThis tag contains a single-line description of the edit that should be made at the given location.\n\n### `<operation>` (required)\n\nThis tag indicates what type of change should be made, relative to the given location. It can be one of the following:\n- `update`: Rewrites the specified string entirely based on the given description.\n- `create`: Creates a new file with the given path based on the provided description.\n- `insert_before`: Inserts new text based on the given description before the specified search string.\n- `insert_after`: Inserts new text based on the given description after the specified search string.\n- `delete`: Deletes the specified string from the containing file.\n\n<guidelines>\n- There's no need to describe *what* to do, just *where* to do it.\n- Only reference locations that actually exist (unless you're creating a file).\n- If creating a file, assume any subsequent updates are included at the time of creation.\n- Don't create and then update a file. Always create new files in one hot.\n- Prefer multiple edits to smaller regions, as opposed to one big edit to a larger region.\n- Don't produce edits that intersect each other. In that case, merge them into a bigger edit.\n- Never nest an edit with another edit. Never include CDATA. All edits are leaf nodes.\n- Descriptions are required for all edits except delete.\n- When generating multiple edits, ensure the descriptions are specific to each individual operation.\n- Avoid referring to the search string in the description. Focus on the change to be made, not the location where it's made. That's implicit with the `search` string you provide.\n- Don't generate multiple edits at the same location. Instead, combine them together in a single edit with a succinct combined description.\n- Always ensure imports are added if you're referencing symbols that are not in scope.\n</guidelines>\n\nHere are some concrete examples.\n\n<example>\n<message role=\"user\">\n\n```rs src/shapes.rs\npub mod rectangle;\npub mod circle;\n```\n\n```rs src/shapes/rectangle.rs\npub struct Rectangle {\n    width: f64,\n    height: f64,\n}\n\nimpl Rectangle {\n    pub fn new(width: f64, height: f64) -> Self {\n        Rectangle { width, height }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```rs src/shapes/circle.rs\npub struct Circle {\n    radius: f64,\n}\n\nimpl Circle {\n    pub fn new(radius: f64) -> Self {\n        Circle { radius }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nUpdate all shapes to store their origin as an (x, y) tuple and implement Display.\n</message>\n\n<message role=\"assistant\">\nWe'll need to update both the rectangle and circle modules.\n\n<step>\nAdd origin fields to both shape types.\n\n```rust\nstruct Rectangle {\n    // existing fields ...\n    origin: (f64, f64),\n}\n```\n\n```rust\nstruct Circle {\n    // existing fields ...\n    origin: (f64, f64),\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/rectangle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_before</operation>\n<search>\n    width: f64,\n    height: f64,\n</search>\n<description>Add the origin field to Rectangle</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/circle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_before</operation>\n<search>\n    radius: f64,\n</search>\n<description>Add the origin field to Circle</description>\n</edit>\n\n<step>\nUpdate both shape's constructors to take an origin.\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/rectangle.rs</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<search>\n    fn new(width: f64, height: f64) -> Self {\n        Rectangle { width, height }\n    }\n</search>\n<description>Update the Rectangle new function to take an origin</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/circle.rs</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<search>\n    fn new(radius: f64) -> Self {\n        Circle { radius }\n    }\n</search>\n<description>Update the Circle new function to take an origin</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nImplement Display for both shapes\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/rectangle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_before</operation>\n<search>\nstruct Rectangle {\n</search>\n<description>Add an import for the `std::fmt` module</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/rectangle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_after</operation>\n<search>\n        Rectangle { width, height }\n    }\n}\n</search>\n<description>Add a Display implementation for Rectangle</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/circle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_before</operation>\n<search>\nstruct Circle {\n</search>\n<description>Add an import for the `std::fmt` module</description>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/shapes/circle.rs</path>\n<operation>insert_after</operation>\n<search>\n        Circle { radius }\n    }\n}\n</search>\n<description>Add a Display implementation for Circle</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n</message>\n</example>\n\n<example number=2>\n<message role=\"user\">\n\n```rs src/user.rs\nstruct User {\n    pub name: String,\n    age: u32,\n    email: String,\n}\n\nimpl User {\n    fn new(name: String, age: u32, email: String) -> Self {\n        User { name, age, email }\n    }\n\n    pub fn print_info(&self) {\n        todo!()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nLet's print all the user information and delete the email field.\n</message>\n\n<message role=\"assistant\">\n<step>\nUpdate the 'print_info' method to print user information\n\n```rust\nimpl User {\n    // ... other methods ...\n\n    pub fn print_info(&self) {\n        println!(\"Name: {name}, Age: {age}\", name = self.name, age = self.age);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/user.rs</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<search>\n    pub fn print_info(&self) {\n        todo!()\n    }\n</search>\n<description>Print all the user information</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nRemove the 'email' field from the User struct\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/user.rs</path>\n<operation>delete</operation>\n<search>\nemail: String,\n</search>\n</edit>\n\n<edit>\n<path>src/user.rs</path>\n<operation>update</operation>\n<symbol>\nfn new(name: String, age: u32, email: String) -> Self {\n    User { name, age, email }\n}\n</symbol>\n<description>Remove email parameter from new method</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n</message>\n</example>\n\nYou should think step by step. When possible, produce smaller, coherent logical steps as opposed to one big step that combines lots of heterogeneous edits.\n\n</task_description>\n\ncreate a bash script to download a video from a dailymotion link\nCertainly! I'll guide you through creating a bash script to download a video from a Dailymotion link. We'll use the popular tool `youtube-dl` for this purpose, as it supports Dailymotion along with many other video platforms.\n\n<step>\nCreate a new bash script file\n\nFirst, let's create a new file for our bash script.\n\n<edit>\n<path>download_dailymotion.sh</path>\n<operation>create</operation>\n<description>Create the bash script file</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nAdd the shebang and script content\n\nNow, let's add the content to our script:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Check if a URL is provided\nif [ $# -eq 0 ]; then\n    echo \"Please provide a Dailymotion video URL\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n# Check if youtube-dl is installed\nif ! command -v youtube-dl &> /dev/null; then\n    echo \"youtube-dl is not installed. Please install it first.\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n# Download the video\necho \"Downloading video from $1\"\nyoutube-dl \"$1\"\n\necho \"Download complete!\"\n```\n\n<edit>\n<path>download_dailymotion.sh</path>\n<operation>insert_after</operation>\n<search>#!/bin/bash</search>\n<description>Add script content to check for URL and youtube-dl, then download the video</description>\n</edit>\n</step>\n\n<step>\nMake the script executable\n\nAfter creating the script, we need to make it executable.\n\n```bash\nchmod +x download_dailymotion.sh\n```\n\nThis step doesn't require an edit to the file, but it's a necessary action to take in the terminal.\n</step>\n\nNow you have a bash script that can download videos from Dailymotion. To use it, you would run:\n\n```bash\n./download_dailymotion.sh [Dailymotion_URL]\n```\n\nReplace `[Dailymotion_URL]` with the actual URL of the video you want to download.\n\nNote: This script assumes that `youtube-dl` is installed on your system. If it's not, you'll need to install it first. On most Unix-like systems, you can install it using your package manager (e.g., `apt-get install youtube-dl` on Ubuntu) or by following the installation instructions on the youtube-dl GitHub page.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":188}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":18},"start":7985,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":189}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":19},"start":9967,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":190}}}],"summary":"Create Dailymotion Video Downloader Bash Script","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":7919},"icon":"Route","label":"Workflow","metadata":null}]}
